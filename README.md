# -Compass-Project
I would like to mantion that this implementation is not perferct. Implementing this with MVVM was, a bit overhead. I thnik it would be better with LifeCycle Components. 
Right now because of implementing this with MVVM implementation, the desire direction is lost in the moment of onClear of ViewModel(Exmaple change app). In implementation where components must respond to lifecycle of app.
