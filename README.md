# -Compass-Project
I would like to mantion that this implementation is not perferct. Implementing this with MVVM was, a bit overhead. I thnik it would be better with LifeCycleObserver. 
Right now because of implementing this with MVVM implementation, the desire direction is lost in the moment of onClear of ViewModel(Exmaple change app).
